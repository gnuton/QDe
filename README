Since I was annoyed to use KDE I decided to switch to a smaller and minimal desktop environment.
Browsing internet I've seen there were not so many Qt desktop environments.

After trying all available forks, I decided to work on Antico Deluxe because it looks clean and well done. I would like to contribute to the main project but actually I don't like at all the MacOS style.
I want something new! That's why I forked the original project.  

Cheers,
Antonio

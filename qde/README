QDe is a experimental fork of Antico Deluxe.

Antico Deluxe is a Qt4/X11 Window/Desktop manager for GNU/Linux.
It is a fork of famous Antico WM/DE by Giuseppe Cigala, http://antico.wordpress.com/

The goal is to create a Window/Desktop manager simple and fast, with very aesthetic
and familiar look and feel. 
A very few parameters must be configured from few files, avoiding unnecessary complications, 
following the K.I.S.S. philosophy. Any other configurations like themes, icons etc. should be avoided.
If you don't like the heaviness of KDE/Gnome, contribute at development...

The whole application is based on "$HOME/.config/AnticoDeluxe/AnticoDeluxe.conf" file for now.
The overall look and feel have to be very close to MacOSX look and feel, which is

1. AMELIB - support library - should be keep as small as possible, with very few classes.
2. Desktop without icons for now.
3. The Top Bar with system and applications menu, and few useful widgets/plugins.
4. The bottom Dock, which acts as taskbar and iconic application launcher.
5. NOT STARTED: File Manager

7. NOT STARTED: some day-to-day use applications like text editor, picture viewer etc.
8. NOT STARTED: Login Manager
